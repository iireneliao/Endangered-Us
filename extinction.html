    <h1 class="header-1">What Is Species Extinction?</h1>
    <p class="p1">Species extinction is the termination of a kind of an organism or a group of species. It is also deemed as the death of the last individual of a species.</p>

    <h1 class="header-2">Causes Of Species Extinction</h>
    <p class="p11">There are many different reasons and factors of the extinction of a species as it is usually a natural phenomenon. However, due to human activity, extinction rates have been increasing with activities including:</p>
     <h1 class="h41"> 1. Habitat Loss</h1>
       <p class="p2">Habitat loss is caused by man-made destruction or natural disasters. For instance, earthquakes and tsunamis are natural disasters. Mining, urbanization, dredging, agriculture, forestry are all man-made destruction that causes many extinctions.</p>
       <h1 class="h42"> 2. Over Hunting </h1>
        <p class="p3"> Whooly mammoths, Caspian tigers, West African black rhinos, and much more were magnificent creatures hunted to extinction due to the lack of proper legislation protecting these creatures.</p>
       <h1 class="h43"> 3. Invasion Of Alien/Invasive Species</h1>
         <p class="p4">An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native. One of the main causes of the Dodo bird's extinction was the invasion of these species: rats, pigs, domestic animals. Those alien species were introduced by Dutch sailors in 1598 and dramatically threatened the Dodo bird's survival.</p>
         <h1 class="h44"> 4. Pollution</h1>
           <p class="p5">All types of pollution (air, water, soil) have proved to be harmfully affecting species and their survival. For example, marine animals are threatened by water pollution, which includes pieces of plastic that can be harmful to sealife.</p>

           <h1 class="header3">Effects Of Species Extinction</h1> 
           <p class="p33">Studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that biologically diverse ecosystems are more productive. As a result, there has been growing concern that the very high rates of modern extinctions could reduce natureâ€™s ability to provide goods and services like food, clean water, and a stable climate. Species loss is expected to reduce plant growth by 5 to 10. At higher levels of extinction (41 to 60 percent of species), the impacts of species loss ranked with those of many other major drivers of environmental change, such as ozone pollution, acid deposition on forests, and nutrient pollution.</p>
