			<figcaption class="irenedesc">Hi! My name is Irene Liao and I'm a rising senior from the LA county in California. I've had coding experience with Java in the past, but this is my first ever website project using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS! Connecting to Endangered Us, I've always felt passionate about the environment that we all live in and how broken it was. Therefore, I love working with this team to spread awareness about the anthropogenic causes and effects of species endangerment.</figcaption>

			<figcaption class="annalizedesc">Hi! My name is Annalize Wilson and I’m a rising junior in high school from Los Angeles. This is my first year ever coding with Kode With Klossy and learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript! As a teenager, I’ve started to become more passionate about the climate we live in and finding ways on how to help save this beautiful earth. With Endangered Us, a passionate group of girls and I came together to strive for environmental change and spread awareness of species endangerment.</figcaption>

			<figcaption class="floradesc"> Hi! My name is Flora Litvinova, and I am a rising sophomore from Los Angeles. I have some experience with HTML, but I have never worked with CSS or JavaScript before the start of the camp. Kode With Klossy gave me a great opportunity to learn how to code and to create a website dedicated to the topic that I really care about: species endangerment. From a young age, I have been passionate about environmental issues like climate change and species extinction. The reason why my wonderful team and I created a website that spreads awareness about the species endangerment is because we think that people should learn more about the ways they can help the environment.</figcaption>

Kode With Klossy Camp has given the opportunity to discover the coding world, and actually be capable of building my own website! As an environmentalist, I have always been interested in getting my voice to the world about what's happening around the world, from climate change, to species endangerment/extinction, so what better opportunity than to learn how to code my own website, about the topic I have always been interested in, and wanted to educate as much people about!

			<h1 class="kwktitle">Origins of Endangered Us & Kode With Klossy</h1>
			<p class="kwkdesc">Kode With Klossy is a coding camp program led by powerful women. Our team met through the Kode With Klossy's Web Development camp with instructors, Emily and Lucy. As a norm, a built website was given to the scholars as an end-of-camp project. The Endangered Us team took that challenge to inform our audience about what we were passionate about—environmental problems. That topic led to the idea of Endangered Us, where we focus on the saving efforts of endangered species. We wouldn't have been able to do this without Kode With Klossy. :)</p>
